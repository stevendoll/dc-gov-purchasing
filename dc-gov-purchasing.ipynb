    "D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser has pitched her plan to create family homeless shelters in almost every ward of the city as an equitable way for the community to share the burden of caring for the neediest residents.\n",

And experts have calculated that the city leases­ would increase the assessed value of those properties by as much as 10 times for that small group of landowners and developers.\n",

    "How much taxpayer money would be paid to a handful of well-connected private landowners, developers and their agents is expected to be a focus of a hearing Thursday before the D.C. Council.\n",
